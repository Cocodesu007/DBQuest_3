Implementation Plan - Content Updates & Standardization
I will update the 
oracle-products.html
 and 
mysql-products.html
 pages with new content provided by the user, create a new consulting-services.html page, and propagate the header/footer changes from 
index.html
 to other pages.

Proposed Changes
Content Updates
[MODIFY] 
oracle-products.html
Replace existing content with the new "Oracle Database Options", "Management Packs", and "Engineering System" sections.
Use a clean, sectioned layout with the "glassmorphism" cards to avoid overwhelming the user.
Group related items (e.g., all "Options" in one grid, "Packs" in another).
[MODIFY] 
mysql-products.html
Replace content with the provided 3 MySQL editions.
maintain card-based layout.
[NEW] consulting-services.html
Create a new page for "Database Consulting Services".
Add the "Proactive" and "Reactive" services lists.
Ensure it sends users to 
contact.html
 for inquiries.
Navigation & Layout
[MODIFY] All HTML Pages (
about.html
, 
products.html
, etc.)
Copy the updated <header> (Nav menu) from 
index.html
 to all other pages to include new dropdown links.
Copy the updated <footer> from 
index.html
.
Add "Database Consulting Services" to the navigation dropdown in all files.
Verification
Check all pages for broken links in the navbar.
Verify 
oracle-products.html

Verify consulting-services.html exists and looks consistent.
